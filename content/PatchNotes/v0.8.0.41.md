Greetings, **Gatekeepers**!  
  
Version **0.8.0.41** is now available for download.  
  
**Fixed:** Keeper's Mines could play the death particle and sound multiple times upon being killed.  
**Fixed:** Softlock sometimes occurred when activating Quorium.  
**Fixed:** Using certain skills during Quorium activation left projectiles from those skills in the gatekeeper's hands.  
**Fixed:** The Prince could randomly stop attacking and just stand still.  
  
**Changed:** The base health level of Mediator increased to 120.  
**Changed:** Increased priority of Sirens in navigation on the navmesh. Other enemies now try to stay away from Sirens.  
**Changed:** Enemy health and damage scaling values were slightly decreased.  
  
_Also, a large number of minor errors cluttering the logs have been fixed._  
  
We are very grateful for your feedback.  
**Don't forget to update the game before playing multiplayer.**
