# v0.8.5.07 Now Live!
**Hello Gatekeepers!**  
  
We've gathered your feedback from the last update and have started working on some fixes and improvements to the game!  
  
**General:**  

- Reduced the starting price of artifacts in Obelisks.  
    
- Slightly increased the price of artifacts in Delta.  
    
- Increased the base damage of all Gatekeepers.  
    
- Increased the sprint speed of all Gatekeepers, except Tech Hunter.  
    
- Slightly increased the starting number of enemies in locations.  
    
- Now, when a Siren Statue is activated, all remaining enemies in the location become aware of you.  
    
- All Obelisks are now highlighted on the minimap by default, regardless of distance.  
    
- All objects required for completing tasks are highlighted on the minimap by default, regardless of distance.  
    
- Pickable items (Omni Stones and items from Greed’s Gambit artifact) are now displayed on the minimap.  
    
- Added a tooltip above the Forge. You can now check what's in the Forge without opening it.  
    
- Slightly reduced the base HP of Sirens.

  
**Fixes:**  

- Enemy levels weren't resetting in the arena during repeat runs.  
    
- Some projectiles weren’t functioning or were not working correctly. For example: Essence, Cannonade, etc.  
    
- Fixed several typos in descriptions.  
    
- Fixed incorrect display of some values in Tech Hunter’s chest tooltip.  
    
- Fixed an issue where clients were being kicked out of runs in the later stages, causing the host to encounter softlocks or crashes.

  
  
Thank you for your valuable feedback!  
We hope your gaming experience continues to improve.
