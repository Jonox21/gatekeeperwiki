# Interplanetary Store Update
Greetings, Gatekeepers!  
  
We are excited to announce the release of the first major update, which brings more depth to build creation, expands some existing mechanics, and adds many new features!  
  

List of the major changes:

  

Delta

  
After completing each location, **players will now be transported to Quiet Bay on the planet Delta**. In Quiet Bay, time stops, and **players can use the forge, buy artifacts from pedestals, assemble Triads**, and simply take a short break.  
For each completed location, an additional pedestal will appear in Quiet Bay, increasing the selection of artifacts.  
  
In future updates, the functionality of Quiet Bay will be expanded.  
  

Triads

  
Triads are **combinations of three artifacts** that, in some cases, enhance the effect of one artifact, and in other cases provide completely new effects.  
  
Triads can be crafted in Quiet Bay at the Shrine of Triads.  
  
Initially, there will be **15 types of Triads available**, but this list will grow in the future.  
  
Here is the list of currently available Triads:  
1) **Triad of Scorch** - Each HVC bounce ignites the target.  
2) **Triad of Life** - Activating any interactive object increases Maximum Health by 10%. The accumulated effect resets upon appearing in the next location.  
3) **Triad of Carnage** - Skirmish projectile bounces off enemies up to 10 times.  
4) **Triad of Regeneration** - After Fractal activation, regeneration is doubled until Fractal is restored.  
5) **Triad of Shock** - Each hit on a stunned enemy causes an explosion.  
6) **Triad of Ember** - Protocol hits ignite enemies.  
7) **Triad of Calibration** - Critical hits reset 5% of the current skill cooldowns.  
8) **Triad of Assault** - Duo now flies alongside Buzz and Vanguard.  
9) **Triad of Cinderstorm** - Cinder Flare triggers at 75/50/25/0 percent of enemy's health.  
10) **Triad of Argument** - Increased Argument radius.  
11) **Triad of Reflection** - Karma is triggered by any hit on the gatekeeper.  
12) **Triad of Lumilore** - Meteorites hit enemies precisely if they are within the area of effect.  
13) **Triad of Devastation** - Delugeon triggers on the death of any enemy marked with the Bane Seal.  
14) **Triad of Tides** - Hollow Talisman now attacks with Rippletide.  
15) **Triad of Fireflow** - While Reflex is active, a trail of fire is left behind the gatekeeper.  
  

Chaos Wards

  
**A new objective** where players must destroy up to 4 Chaos Wards by activating and clearing their points.  
**Activating a Ward also triggers its effect.** Each Ward has its own effect.  
  
Here is the list of current Ward effects:  
1) **Toxic Touch** - Ward imbues all enemies' attacks with poison essence.  
2) **Void Heal** - All enemies at the location gain strong health regeneration.  
3) **Veil of Mist** - Fog thickens at the location.  
4) **Detonation Shard** - Detonating shards remain from slain enemies.  
5) **Chrono Drift** - Clearing each Ward point slows down gatekeepers.  
6) **Repel Pulse** - Ward points push away gatekeepers.  
7) **Storm Rods** - Ward places storm rods throughout the location.  
8) **Caustic Pour** - Ward creates acid rain zones at the location.  
9) **Meteorium** - Ward summons a meteor shower.  
10) **Solar Flare** - Ward summons fire rays that chase gatekeepers.  
  

Teammate Resurrection

  
Now, in co-op play, **players can revive a fallen teammate**. To do so, approach their gravestone and interact with it for a short time.  
The teammate will return to life with 30% health.  
  

Conflict Altar

  
The Conflict Altar is a new point of interest at locations. When activated, **it summons a large number of difficult enemies**. The reward is prisms.  
  

General

  

- Locations have been completely reworked. They are now **3-4 times larger than before**.  
    
- **1 location = 1 planet**. There are 4 locations in the cycle.  
    
- Containers with keys have been added to the "Cell Of The Ancients" objective. **There is no longer a need to kill enemies and hope for key drops.**  
    
- **Prisms, the in-game currency, have returned**. For each enemy killed, players receive prisms, which can be spent on purchasing new artifacts.  
    
- Players now **control the appearance of Sirens** at locations by touching the Siren Statue after completing the main objective.  
    
- After defeating a Siren, an Obelisk of Catharsis appears, **allowing players to choose 1 of 2 free high-rarity artifacts.**

- Added the ability for clients **to rejoin a run after disconnecting from the host**.  
    
- Sections with status effects and Triads **have been added to the Database**.  
    
- **A mini-map has been added**, showing all interactive objects. The edge-of-screen indicators have been removed, and all information has been moved to the mini-map.  
    
- There are now **always 2 Totems at locations.**  
    
- **17 new in-game/Steam achievements** have been added.  
    
- **The passive ability of Tech Hunter has been redesigned.** Now, items do not drop from killed enemies but are located in containers throughout the location. The containers are visible only to the Tech Hunter.
